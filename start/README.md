## **KnowledgeHut upGrad | Hackathon Submission**

This is my submission for the KnowledgeHut Hackathon. The web app holds a quiz which is responsive on both mobile and desktop devices.

- ```src/index.html``` : This is the root HTML document
- ```src/quiz.html``` : This is the html file where each quiz and its results are rendered
- ```src/js```: This folder hosts all the relevant js files
- ```src/data```: This folder has a file named ```data.js``` that holds the database of questions and answers
  - ```src/css```: This folder holds the CSS stylesheet for the entire project

**Instructions**
1. Clone the repo and run ``npm install``
2. From the app folder run ``npm run dev``
3. The 'Reset' button resets the local storage so that previously attempted quizzes become available to attempt once again.
